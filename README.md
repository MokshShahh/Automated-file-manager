# Automated-file-manager
This project is a Python script designed to help organize files in a cluttered folder. It takes the path of a folder as input and sorts the files within that folder based on their file extensions. The script creates subfolders named after the unique file extensions found in the main folder, and then moves each file into its corresponding subfolder.

For example, if the main folder contains files with extensions like .pdf, .docx, and .pptx, the script will create subfolders named pdf, docx, and pptx, and move all the PDF files into the pdf subfolder, Word documents into the docx subfolder, and PowerPoint presentations into the pptx subfolder.
