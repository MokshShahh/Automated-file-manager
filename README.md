# Automated-file-manager
A fully automated file organiser and manager made using python.
It takes a folder path as an input and sorts every files according to thier extension within the folder.
NOTE: Any sub folders within the main folder are ignored.
This code will create many folders within the main folder with the name of the extension of the files.
For example: if there are files with extension .pdf in main folder
             this program will create another folder named "pdf" inside the main folder and all files with extenion ".pdf" will be moved into this pdf folder
